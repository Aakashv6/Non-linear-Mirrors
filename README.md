### Atomically thin semiconductors as Non Linear Mirrors

By: Aakash, Aditya Ranjan, Amal Mathew, Yuktee Gupta


Abstract
In this project we review the paper titled "Atomically thin semiconductors as Non Linear Mirrors" published by Zeytinoglu et. al. in 2017.
We will begin with an introduction to the paper and cover some of the background needed to understand it.
We will then explain the paper in three parts:
(i) Assuming no exciton interactions,
(ii) Accounting for inter-excitonic interactions in the mean field limit,
(iii) Accounting for quantum fluctuations.
We reproduce the plots presented in the paper with the help of the QuTip library in python.
